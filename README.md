# crypto-coding-beginner-projects
Welcome to my beginner-level cryptography and cybersecurity-focused coding repository! ðŸš€  
Here, Iâ€™ll be building simple but powerful projects using **Python** and **Java**, with a long-term focus on learning **cybersecurity** and **cryptographic algorithms**.
### 1. Caesar Cipher (Python)
My first cryptography project using a simple Caesar Cipher encryption method.

ðŸ”¸ **What it does**:  
- Takes an input string (plaintext)  
- Takes a shift key (number)  
- Encrypts the text using Caesar cipher logic  
- Decrypts it back (optional)
## ðŸ“Œ Goals of this Repository

- Learn the basics of **encryption algorithms** (Caesar, VigenÃ¨re, etc.)
- Build small **security tools**
- Apply code in both **Python** and **Java**
- Understand real-world **cybersecurity concepts** step-by-step
